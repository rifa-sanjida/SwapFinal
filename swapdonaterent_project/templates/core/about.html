        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2025, SwapDonateRent began as a
            university Python lab project by me and my four friends.
            We built it to make swapping, donating,
            and renting easier â€” and to turn a small
            idea into something meaningful.</p>

    <div class="about-section">
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>SwapDonateRent was created with a simple mission:
            to reduce waste and build stronger communities by making it
            easy to share resources. We believe that every item deserves a second chance,
            and every community can benefit from sharing what they have.</p>

    <div class="about-section">
        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>We provide a platform where people can:</p>

            <li>Swap items they no longer need for things they want</li>
            <li>Donate items to people who can use them</li>
            <li>Rent out items to earn extra income</li>
